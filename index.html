			<p>Blackpink is a South Korean girl group formed by YG Entertainment, consisting of members Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé and Lisa. The group debuted 
			on August 8, 2016, with their single album Square One, which spawned "Whistle", their first number-one song in South Korea, as well as 
			"Boombayah", their first number-one hit on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart, which set the record as the most-viewed debut music 
			video by a Korean act. With the group's early commercial success, they were hailed as the New Artist of the Year at the 31st Golden Disc 
			Awards and the 26th Seoul Music Awards. As of 2018, Blackpink is the highest-charting female K-pop act on both Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard 
			200, peaking at number 55 with "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du", and peaking at number 40 with Square Up, respectively. They are also the first and only K-pop 
			girl group to enter and top Billboard's Emerging Artists chart. They are also the first female K-pop group to have four number-one singles on 
			Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart. At the time of its release, "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" was the most-viewed Korean music video in 24 hours on 
			YouTube, and in January 2019, it became the most viewed music video by a K-pop group on the website. Blackpink is the best-charting female 
			Korean act ever. And that’s an incredibly impressive accomplishment, especially when you consider how much competition there is in the K-Pop 
			world. But BLACKPINK has a unique approach to their group image and identity, which makes them especially popular right now. </p>
